Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:MapLib:979 - LUT4 symbol
   "data_flow/display_changer_inst/SEVEN_SEGMENTS_DISPLAY<0>73" (output
   signal=SEVEN_SEGMENTS_DISPLAY_0_OBUF) has input signal "ANODES_0_OBUF" which
   will be trimmed. See Section 5 of the Map Report File for details about why
   the input signal will become undriven.
ERROR:MapLib:979 - LUT4 symbol
   "data_flow/display_changer_inst/SEVEN_SEGMENTS_DISPLAY<1>135" (output
   signal=SEVEN_SEGMENTS_DISPLAY_1_OBUF) has input signal "ANODES_0_OBUF" which
   will be trimmed. See Section 5 of the Map Report File for details about why
   the input signal will become undriven.
ERROR:MapLib:979 - LUT3 symbol
   "data_flow/display_changer_inst/SEVEN_SEGMENTS_DISPLAY<2>131" (output
   signal=SEVEN_SEGMENTS_DISPLAY_2_OBUF) has input signal "ANODES_0_OBUF" which
   will be trimmed. See Section 5 of the Map Report File for details about why
   the input signal will become undriven.

   "data_flow/display_changer_inst/SEVEN_SEGMENTS_DISPLAY<3>80" (output
   signal=SEVEN_SEGMENTS_DISPLAY_3_OBUF) has input signal "ANODES_0_OBUF" which
   will be trimmed. See Section 5 of the Map Report File for details about why
   the input signal will become undriven.

   signal=SEVEN_SEGMENTS_DISPLAY_4_OBUF) has input signal "ANODES_0_OBUF" which
   will be trimmed. See Section 5 of the Map Report File for details about why
   the input signal will become undriven.

   "data_flow/display_changer_inst/SEVEN_SEGMENTS_DISPLAY<6>146" (output
   signal=SEVEN_SEGMENTS_DISPLAY_6_OBUF) has input signal "ANODES_0_OBUF" which
   will be trimmed. See Section 5 of the Map Report File for details about why
   the input signal will become undriven.
ERROR:MapLib:978 - LUT4 symbol
   "data_flow/display_changer_inst/SEVEN_SEGMENTS_DISPLAY<0>73" (output
   signal=SEVEN_SEGMENTS_DISPLAY_0_OBUF) has an equation that uses input pin I0,
   which no longer has a connected signal. Please ensure that all the pins used
   in the equation for this LUT have signals that are not trimmed (see Section 5
   of the Map Report File for details on which signals were trimmed).
